# odin-recipes
Project: Recipes, completed as part of The Odin Project.

This project serves as the first opportunity to practice the HTML knowledge acquired as part of The Odin Project (TOP) curriculum. Using the basics learned, I developed a simple website consisting of a main index page that links to several recipes.

Through completing this project, the following skills were reinforced:
- HTML formatting and syntax 
- Linking between HTML files
- The use of Git
